  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Use Next.js src directory structure with @/ imports (e.g., @/components, @/lib).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Prisma Best Practices
  - Use Prisma Client for database operations; avoid raw SQL when possible.
  - Implement proper error handling for database operations with try-catch blocks.
  - Use Prisma's type-safe queries and leverage TypeScript integration.
  - Structure database operations in dedicated service files (e.g., @/lib/services).
  - Use Prisma's relation queries efficiently; avoid N+1 problems with include/select.
  - Implement database seeding with Prisma's seed script for development data.
  - Use Prisma migrations for schema changes; never modify the database directly.
  - Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for models, camelCase for fields.
  - Use proper indexes and constraints in the schema for performance.
  - Implement soft deletes using @deletedAt field when needed.
